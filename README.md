# Web Homework 04

## Overview  
This is my Homework 04 responsive website, which includes three functional pages: **Home**, **About**, and **Contact**.

## Known Issue  
In mobile view, the hamburger menu icon is not correctly positioned â€” it appears closer to the center rather than aligned to the right.
